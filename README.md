# Multiclass Text Classification using Machine Learning and Deep Learning on a Hierarchical News Dataset.

##  About the Project

This project explores how well different models perform on classifying news articles into hierarchical categories. The dataset includes:

- 10,917 news articles
- 17 top-level categories
- 109 subcategories

We compare traditional ML models (like Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN) with deep learning (CNNs), and evaluate how incorporating the hierarchy affects classification accuracy and complexity.

##  Models Used

- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVC)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

##  Key Ideas

- **Baseline vs Advanced**: Start with simple ML models, move to deep learning.
- **Flat vs Hierarchical**: Evaluate models with and without using the hierarchy structure.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

## Research Questions

- Do CNNs always outperform classic ML in hierarchical classification?
- Does hierarchy help or complicate text classification?

## Evaluation

All models are evaluated and compared using visual plots and performance metrics.
